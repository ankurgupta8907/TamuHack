# TAMUHack2015 Project
Application Name : BudgetRideApp
####Concept
The application is based on the pp which is focussed for motivating public transport. 
It find an optimized path between two points in a city, which is combination of public transportation and private cabs service.
It is optimized such that it utilizes public transport for few legs and private cab for remaining.
The resultant goal is to provide alternative route compared to complete private transportation which is less expensive and eco-friendly.
Also, we implemented options where users can rate the public transport services and vote for good route for popular destinations (like Airports),
Therefore using crowdsourcing to identify good public transport medium.
